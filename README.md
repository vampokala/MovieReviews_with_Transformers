Movie Reviews with Transformer Models 

## Project Title
**Sentiment Analysis of IMDb Movie Reviews using Transformers**

## Project Description
This project leverages transformer-based models to analyze sentiments in IMDb movie reviews. The goal is to develop a machine learning model that can automatically classify movie reviews as positive or negative, providing valuable insights into audience reactions. This approach is particularly useful in understanding large-scale sentiments which are critical for strategic decisions in the entertainment industry.

## Notebook Overview
The Jupyter notebook `imdb_10K_sentiments_reviews.ipynb` covers the following key areas:
1. **Introduction**: Overview of the problem and the importance of sentiment analysis in the movie industry.
2. **Data Preprocessing**: Steps to clean and prepare the IMDb dataset for analysis.
3. **Modeling**: Application of transformer models, particularly BERT, for sentiment classification.
4. **Evaluation**: Assessment of the model's performance using various metrics.
5. **Results and Conclusion**: Discussion on the findings and potential improvements.

## Prerequisites
Before running the notebook, ensure you have the following installed:
- Python 3.7 or higher
- Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab
- PyTorch
- Transformers library by Hugging Face
- Scikit-learn
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib

You can install the required packages using the following command:
```bash
pip install torch transformers scikit-learn pandas numpy matplotlib
```

## How to Use
1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/vampokala/MovieReviews_with_Transformers.git
   ```
2. **Navigate to the project directory**:
   ```bash
   cd MovieReviews_with_Transformers
   ```
3. **Launch Jupyter Notebook**:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook
   ```
4. **Open and run the notebook**:
   - Open the `imdb_10K_sentiments_reviews.ipynb` file in Jupyter Notebook.
   - Follow the cells sequentially, executing them one by one.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project consists of 10,000 IMDb movie reviews. It includes a balanced mix of positive and negative reviews. You can access the dataset from the IMDb Datasets page [here](https://datasets.imdbws.com/).

## Model
The notebook employs the BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) model from Hugging Face's Transformers library for sentiment analysis. BERT is chosen due to its state-of-the-art performance in various natural language processing tasks.

For more information on BERT, refer to the original paper: [BERT: Pre-training of Deep Bidirectional Transformers for Language Understanding](https://arxiv.org/abs/1810.04805).

## Evaluation Metrics
The model's performance is evaluated using:
- **Accuracy**: The ratio of correctly predicted instances to the total instances.
- **Precision**: The ratio of correctly predicted positive observations to the total predicted positives.
- **Recall**: The ratio of correctly predicted positive observations to all observations in the actual class.
- **F1 Score**: The weighted average of Precision and Recall.

## Results
The sentiment analyzer provides insights into how well the model performs in classifying movie reviews. Detailed results and visualizations are available in the notebook.
